                With the corporate sector changing rapidly, a strategy for

                marketplace. Furthermore, as work-from-home and hybrid working
                are becoming more common, brands must align their objectives
                accordingly and provide an employee-centric work environment.

              in their tenure as an employee. It can be hourly, daily, weekly,
